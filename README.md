### GPT-Based Smart Assistant

#### Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop an interactive voice-controlled assistant leveraging OpenAI's GPT model to understand and respond to user queries in natural language. This assistant aims to enhance user interaction by providing a seamless and intuitive experience through speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion.

#### Core Functionality
* **Voice Command Recognition**: The assistant captures audio commands from the user and converts them into text using a speech recognition module.
* **Natural Language Processing**: It uses OpenAI's powerful GPT-4o model to process natural language queries and generate intelligent, human-like responses.
* **Text-to-Speech**: The generated text responses are converted back into speech, providing an auditory reply to the user.
* **Web Browser Automation**: The assistant can perform specific tasks, such as opening websites (e.g., Google, YouTube), based on predefined voice commands.

#### Technologies Used
* **OpenAI**: For accessing the GPT-4o model.
* **speech_recognition**: To convert spoken commands to text.
* **pyttsx3**: For converting text output to voice.
* **webbrowser**: To open web pages based on user commands.
